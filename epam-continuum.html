				<p>Due to the client confidentiality, I am unable to share my all of my experience online.</p>

				<p>While the supply chain works to backfill the supply shortage of protective masks, EPAM Continuum created a simple, ease to manufacture design that can be quickly and locally manufactured to fill the supply gap due to COVID-19. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9aMin8DRBQ&feature=youtu.be">See the video here</a>. The GENTL Mask is an open source design that utilizes readily available materials and incredibly simple manufacturing processes to enable localized manufacturing.</p>

				<p>100,000+ masks have been produced and donated to healthcare workers. This is still an on-going project with more masks still being produced.</p>
