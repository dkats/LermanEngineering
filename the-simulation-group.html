	<p>At the Sim Group, I worked with a team of 3 engineers and technical staff on various medical simulation projects. These projects included: working with nurses of local hospitals to get feedback on an IV Insertion Trainer, testing of early stage prototypes, and fabrication and assembly of simulation devices. The main project I focused on was the creation of a one of a kind variable density gelatin 3D printer for rapid anatomical simulation.</p>

	<h2>VARIABLE DENSITY GELATIN 3D PRINTER FOR MEDICAL SIMULATION</h2>

		<p>The purpose of this project was to create a 3D printer kit that can be added to an off-the-shelf printer kit to enable rapid prototyping of variable density gelatin models. At its completion, almost all components of the printer were able to be fabricated by the off-the-shelf printer and then assembled by a novice. The printer consisted of two heated reservoirs that contained a high density and a low density food grade gelatin. The pumps were connected by tubing to peristaltic pumps and extruded through a nozzle onto a liquid cooled print bed.</p>

		<p>The project started as a master's thesis by a previous employee, but it was left unfinished and nonoperational. I completed the project and successfully printed a test piece.</p>

		<p>Initially, I designed the system to mix a high density and low density gelatin to create various density voxels that were extruded through a single nozzle. Through testing, it was determined that switching the extrusion to two nozzles&mdash;one for each reservoir&mdash;was a better solution. This way the printer can create a raster of the two densities that ultimately felt like a single density.</p>
