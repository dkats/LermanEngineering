	<p><a href="http://www.numotorsports.com/">Northeastern Baja SAE</a> is a student-run organization that designs, builds, and races an off-road vehicle against over one hundred other universities around the world. Most recently, the team placed 5th and 7th overall in two competitions against 110 other teams.</p>

	<p>As the Vice President and Drivetrain Lead, I'm responsible for all members of the team and the development of the drivetrain of the vehicle.</p>

			<p>The first gearbox I designed for the car was a two-stage 4.69:1 reduction with case hardened gears and a 6061 enclosure. All parts were custom designed and fabricated (except for gear teeth and splines) in our shop. This gearbox featured an integrated brake caliper mount and a hexagonal output shaft that holds the brake rotor. Bearings were thermally fit into the case. The gears and shafts were welded together instead of keyed. The welds were validated through a torsion test on replica shafts and gear blanks. The case was machined in house and final assembly. This gearbox performed well and saw no failures.</p>

			<p>The new gearbox was designed to be lighter, while maintaining the same factor of safety in all key FEA tests. The internals of the gearbox were not revised, but the case underwent a drastic modifications. It was designed from inside out, as opposed to outside in like the previous case. The 6061 closely hugs all the gears and bearings and ribs were used to strengthen the thin walls. Ultimately, it resulted in a weight savings of 58% in comparison to the previous case.</p>

	<h2>GEARBOX 2018</h2>

	<div class="wrap">
		<span style="margin: 0 1em;">
			<p>Based on testing of the 2017 gearbox, the 2018 gearbox was created. This gearbox was the lightest yet, weighing in at just 12 pounds. It is the lightest gearbox to have ever been constructed on the team. It features similarly welded 8620 gears and shafts, but with dramatically reduced faced widths. The aluminum case is thin walled and supported with brackets.</p>
