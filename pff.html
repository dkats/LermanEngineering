	<p>At <a href="http://piaggiofastforward.com/">Piaggio Fast Forward</a> (PFF) I worked closely with a small mechanical team to develop a cargo vehicle, Gita, that can follow humans or operate fully autonomously.</p>

			<p>For my first month and throughout my co-op, I worked on fabrication and assembly of the robot, Gita. I did a lot of work with composites, machining, and 3D printing. Highlighted below are several of my projects at PFF.</p>

	<h2>ELECTROHYDRAULIC BRAKING SYSTEM</h2>

		</div>

		<p>This system was designed for use with Kilo, a larger robot that can carry many times more weight than Gita. Due to its large load capacity, it requires the use of mechanical brakes to stop. Before design began, I made an Excel calculator to guide the design requirements for the entire braking system. This system consists of a hydraulic master cylinder, reservoir, servo motor, and linkage. The hydraulic tubing, caliper, and rotor are not pictured. The servo motor is used to drive the piston of the master cylinder, which actuates the brakes and slows down the vehicle. The servo can be rotated to different angles to exert varying amounts of braking force. With a feedback loop, the system can self adjust for pad wear. The linkages and mounting plates are made from water-jet aluminum and the master mount is machined aluminum.</p>

	<h2>BODY PANEL MOUNTS</h2>

				<p>This mounting system was designed to hold the body panels in a precise position on the robot. The panels needed to be easily removable while also holding the entire weight of Gita through external handles that the user can use to pick up the robot. These mounts were designed in Fusion 360 and printed on MarkForged printers that lay carbon fiber strands within the plastic. The mounts were extensively tested to ensure they are able to support the load required. A quarter-turn fastener releases the entire body panel.</p>

	<h2>ADJUSTABLE THIRD WHEEL</h2>

		<p>As a concept, the robot may have included a third wheel that allows for harder braking. As the robot pitches forward while braking, the third wheel would contact the ground and prevent Gita from rolling over. This wheel needed to be adjustable in height and rapidly attached to the robot for testing. I made a quick and dirty fixture to hold the plastic wheel  at different heights. A screw in one block allows the wheel shaft to move up and down, while the other block acts as a guiding pin. This project was more about intricate machining with a mill and lathe as well as a test in packaging.</p>
